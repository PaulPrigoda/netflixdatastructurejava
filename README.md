# netflixdatastructurejava
This was a final project I had for my data structures class. We were tasked to create a basic version of the streaming service Netflix using data structures. We were given a couple data structures that were mandatory, but the rest of the structures were up to us to figure out and implement. It's pretty much the structure of Netflix without videos in it.

TO RUN IT YOU HAVE TO RUN THE "Menu2.java" FILE.
